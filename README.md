# Interactive Data Visualization Project (INFO 5100)

- Designed and implemented (using d3.js) a single-page Wine Pairings quiz with interactive elements.
- Data source: Kaggle
- Project Motivation: Combine available data for different wine types with information about food-wine pairings to help new wine drinkers easily choose a bottle. At the same time, the explorative steps of the quiz allow seasoned wine drinkers to find new options to try.
